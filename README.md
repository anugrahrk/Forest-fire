# 🌲🔥 Forest Fire Prediction System

A machine learning and deep learning-based system designed to predict and detect forest fires using meteorological data, satellite images, and live video input. The project helps in early fire detection to assist forest departments and emergency services.

## 📖 About the Project

This project aims to implement a Forest Fire Prediction System using:

- **Machine Learning (ML)** for predicting fire risk based on weather data.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for detecting fire/smoke from satellite images.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for real-time fire detection in videos or live camera feeds.
- A **Flask web application** for an interactive frontend.

## ✨ Features

- 🔥 Predict fire probability using weather data.
- 🛰️ Detect fire/smoke from satellite images.
- 📹 Real-time fire detection from live webcam or uploaded videos.
- 📊 Visualizations: bounding boxes.
- 🖥️ User-friendly web interface.
